# Problem Framing

## 1. Domains

### a. Running
I am on the track team at MIT. I love to run on my own time, and I race during the school year. I always want to optimize my training, but I find it hard to do. I would love for it to be easier to streamline my training and know what I'm doing is good for racing.

### b. Weight lifting
Lifting weights in order to keep fit

### c. Travel
I often find it hard to optimize the best place to travel within a budget. For example, during spring break last year, it was cheaper to travel to Portugal than Florida! I love going to cool unknown places, I just find it hard to actually find them.

### d. Computer building
Optimizing computer parts within a budget

### e. History
I love learning about the history of everything. It is cool to learn about where we come from and how we got here. I often find myself wondering about the history of the exact spot I am standing. I wish I could always know the history of what I am looking at.

### f. Economics
Framing life through an economic lens

### g. Video games
All about playing and making video games.

### h. Men's fashion
Styling oneself as a man

### i. Vice handling
All about maintaining healthy relationships with one's self-identified vices

### j. Nature
All about the understanding and appreciation of nature's wonders

## 2. Problems

### a. Running

#### i. Training Plan Adherence
As a competitive runner, it's difficult to adapt structured training plans to real-life constraints (weather, fatigue, schedule changes) while maintaining the physiological intent of each workout. Missing or modifying workouts creates anxiety about whether I'm still on track for race goals. An app that can automatically make adjustments to a training plan based on goals and unseen constraints utilizing an AI agent powered by tools would be useful. I am including this because I would find this app useful and a rewarding experience to build.

#### ii. Recovery Optimization
Balancing hard training with adequate recovery is guesswork - you don't know if you're recovered enough for the next hard session until you're already struggling through it. This leads to either undertraining from excess caution or overtraining from pushing through fatigue. I am not including this because the implementation would be exceptionally hard, taking into account many different factors, and this to a large part already exists.

#### iii. Race Readiness Assessment
There's no clear way to know if your current fitness level aligns with your race goals until race day. Time trials are imperfect predictors and training paces vary based on conditions, making it hard to gauge whether you're actually prepared for your target times. I am not including this because it would be rather complicated to implement for such a simple feature and usually is better done just by personal assessments. Also, it has a niche audience.

### b. Travel

#### i. A-to-B app
App that allows a user to enter two locations and finds the best way from A to B according to the users preferences. Not including because much of these functions are done by simpler apps like google maps and it would be very complicated to take user preferences into account and user-means into account (ex if the user has a private jet or if the user cannot spend more than $100).

#### ii. Hidden Gem Discovery App
App that takes in a budget and means list from a user and gives a list of the most extravagant places they can go within their budget. Will have to use an AI agent in conjunction with tools to check prices of various means of transportation to various locations. I am including this because it seems like a clever use of AI and tools to discover hidden gems that are within reach and I like the idea of using tool-enabled AI to

#### iii. Local Experience Curation
Once you arrive somewhere off-the-beaten-path, finding authentic local experiences (not tourist traps) requires extensive research across blogs, forums, and reviews, often yielding outdated or unreliable information. Not including because it requires complex websearch and/or tool enabled AI and is not exactly the kind of app I am inspired by.

### c. History

#### i. Location-Based Historical Context
When standing at any random spot, there's no easy way to learn what historically significant events occurred there, who lived there, or how the location has evolved over time - that information exists but isn't accessible in real-time. This would solve my problem of wishing I knew the history of where I was standing at all times. I am including this because it seems like a viable option to integrate with agentic AI, feeding things like coordinates, nearby landmarks, etc to a websearch-capable agent would allow easy generation of location-based history.

#### ii. Personal History Connection
App that keeps track of important historical figures to you and notifies you when you are somewhere in connection to one of them. Not including because this would require either an AI generated database or preexisting database of important locations related to endless historical figures.

#### iii. Historical Significance Ranking
App that ranks the historical importance of places within your area. Not including because this essentially already exists through a number of reviews on google maps.

## 3. Stakeholders

### a. Training plan adherence

#### i. Athlete
The primary user who follows the training plan

#### ii. Coach
Professional trainer who creates or oversees training plans

#### iii. Training Partner
Fellow runners who train alongside the athlete

#### iv. Sports Medicine Professional
Physical therapists, doctors treating running injuries

#### v. Family Member
Spouse/partner affected by training schedule

#### vi. Impacts
The Athlete suffers most directly from poor plan adherence, experiencing anxiety about race preparedness and potentially underperforming. Coaches invest significant time creating plans that lose effectiveness when not followed properly, potentially damaging their reputation. Training Partners rely on group workout schedules that become disrupted when athletes can't maintain consistency. Sports Medicine Professionals see increased injury rates from athletes who compensate poorly for missed workouts. Family Members deal with schedule unpredictability and the athlete's stress about training gaps.

### b. Hidden gem discovery app

#### i. Budget Traveler
Primary user seeking affordable unique destinations

#### ii. Local Business Owner
Restaurants, accommodations in lesser-known destinations

#### iii. Tourism Board
Government agencies promoting off-the-beaten-path locations

#### iv. Travel Companion
Friends/family traveling with the user

#### v. Environmental Conservation Group
Organizations concerned about overtourism

#### vi. Impacts
Budget Travelers waste hours comparing prices across platforms and miss opportunities for affordable adventures. Local Business Owners in hidden gem locations struggle to reach potential visitors who would appreciate their offerings. Tourism Boards in lesser-known regions lose economic opportunities to oversaturated destinations. Travel Companions endure the frustration of lengthy planning sessions or settle for conventional choices. Environmental Conservation Groups benefit when tourism disperses away from overcrowded sites, reducing ecological pressure on popular destinations.

### c. Location-based historical context

#### i. Curious Explorer
Primary user seeking historical information about locations

#### ii. Local Historian
Experts who research and document local history

#### iii. Property Owner
Residents/businesses at historically significant locations

#### iv. Educator
Teachers using location-based learning

#### v. Municipal Heritage Department
Government bodies preserving local history

#### vi. Impacts
Curious Explorers miss countless opportunities to connect with the rich history surrounding them daily. Local Historians see their research underutilized because it's not easily accessible to the public at relevant moments. Property Owners often don't realize the historical significance of their locations, missing opportunities for preservation or cultural tourism. Educators struggle to make history tangible and relevant to students without easy access to location-specific historical context. Municipal Heritage Departments invest in historical preservation but lack effective channels to share this information with citizens and visitors in real-time.

## 5. Features

### a. Training plan adherence

#### i. AI-Powered Plan Adaptation
An intelligent system that automatically adjusts your training plan based on missed workouts, weather conditions, fatigue levels, and schedule changes while maintaining the physiological intent of the original plan. When you miss a run due to rain or work commitments, the app recalculates your remaining workouts to ensure you're still on track for race day without overloading you. This addresses the core anxiety runners face when deviating from rigid plans and helps maintain consistency despite real-world interruptions.

#### ii. Smart Workout Substitution Engine
When you can't complete a planned workout (no access to a track, too tired for intervals, or short on time), the app instantly generates equivalent alternatives that achieve the same training stimulus. A 6x800m track workout becomes a 25-minute tempo run on roads, or a 60-minute long run becomes 45 minutes with hill repeats. This solves the all-or-nothing problem where runners skip workouts entirely when they can't do them perfectly.

#### iii. Progress Confidence Score
A real-time metric that shows how your actual training compares to optimal preparation for your race goal, accounting for the quality and consistency of completed workouts rather than just adherence percentage. The score updates after each workout to show if you're on track, need to adjust your goal time, or should modify upcoming training intensity. This replaces anxiety about missed workouts with data-driven confidence about race readiness.

### b. Hidden gem discovery app

#### i. Budget-First Destination Discovery
A reverse-search engine where users input their total budget, travel dates, and home location, and the app returns a ranked list of the most extraordinary destinations achievable within those constraints. The system would aggregate real-time flight prices, accommodation costs, and daily expenses to show users they could visit Albania's riviera for less than a Florida beach vacation. This solves the problem of travelers missing incredible affordable destinations simply because they don't know how to search for them.

#### ii. Premium Destination Deal Finder
When users enter their travel dates and budget, the app specifically highlights typically expensive destinations (Switzerland, Iceland, Dubai, Tokyo) that become surprisingly affordable during those exact dates due to off-seasons, currency fluctuations, or temporary price drops. It shows that your March dates align with Iceland's cheapest season or that Dubai is 60% cheaper in August, turning "someday" dream destinations into "right now" possibilities. This reveals opportunities where prestigious destinations temporarily match budget traveler prices.

#### iii. Smart Cost Estimator
Uses economic indicators like the Big Mac Index and real-time currency conversion rates to automatically calculate realistic daily budgets for any destination. The app converts your home country's typical costs into local purchasing power, showing that your $100 daily budget stretches to $300 worth of experiences in Vietnam or $50 in Switzerland. This gives travelers instant, accurate cost expectations without complex research or unreliable crowd-sourced data.

### c. Location-based historical context

#### i. Instant History Pages
When you open the app at any location, it automatically generates a custom webpage with all available historical information about that exact spot - from major events to quirky local stories. The page pulls from multiple sources including Wikipedia, local historical societies, old newspapers, and user contributions to create a comprehensive timeline of what happened where you're standing. This transforms any location into a learning opportunity without requiring complex AR or manual searching.

#### ii. Historical Discovery Radius
A simple slider that lets you explore historical sites within a 5 to 100-mile radius of your current location, displayed as pins on an interactive map. Zoom out to see Civil War battlefields within driving distance or zoom in to discover that three historic buildings are within walking distance of your hotel. This turns any location into a basecamp for historical exploration without overwhelming users with constant notifications.

#### iii. Persistent Knowledge Mapping
When the AI generates historical information about a location, it automatically saves the source links and key facts as pins on the map tied to those GPS coordinates. Future visitors to the same spot can instantly access this curated information, building a growing knowledge base where each user's curiosity enriches the experience for the next traveler. This creates an ever-improving historical resource that gets smarter and more comprehensive with each query.
